# Synchronous And Asynchronous Example
ðŸ”¸ Synchronous<br>
- Execution happens line-by-line, one task after another.<br>
- Each task must complete before the next one starts.<br>
- Suitable for simple and predictable workflows.<br>

ðŸ”¸ Asynchronous<br>
- Tasks don't block each other.<br>
- Execution continues while waiting for another task to finish.<br>
- Great for network requests, file I/O, etc.<br>
